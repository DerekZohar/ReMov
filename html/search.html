            <b>Meet The Precious Lion Cub Disney's The Lion King Used As Inspiration For Simba</b><br>
            The new remake of The Lion King is pretty much the movie that fans were wating for, at least if the insane
            box office is to be believed. While the critical notes of the film haven't been glowing, there is one area
            where most fans and critics agree, the photo-realistic animation is stunning. Of course to make a realistic
            looking lion in the new film, the creators of the movie needed some real life assistance, and they found it
            in a lion cub named Bahati who was a model for young Simba.

            <b>The Lion King: 8 Big Differences Between The Original And The Remake</b><br>
            The brand new Lion King is... pretty much just the old Lion King with a new (albeit amazing) coat of paint.
            If you’ve seen the 1994 animated original, then you know know exactly what happens, every plot point, every
            song. But that doesn’t mean there aren’t a few differences between the animated version and the new photo
            realistic version.

            As with many previous Disney remakes, the differences are minor details. The changes don’t make you take a
            new look at the material in any way. Still, for those people who have the original version memorized, every
            little difference counts. Here are the biggest of them.

            masterpiece, a wonderful, excellently realized work filled with spectacle and splendor that has dazzled
            audiences of all ages and through multiple generations. It has inspired direct-to-DVD sequels, an

            not to mention the "live-action" CG remake that's set to be released next month.
